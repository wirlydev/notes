- Abstration
    - hiding details
    - pressing start button on your car hides all the details from the user required to get get the car running
    - 

- constructor
    - if no constructor is defined there is a hidden default no param constructor created
    - if you define a constructor with params, you also need to create the no params constructor as it is only created if there is no constructor defined, so Pet p = new Pet(); would throw an error if only a constructor with params is defined.
    - you can overload constructors with diff parameters
    - calling one constructor from another like this(param1, param2);

- The new operator allocates memory for an object, then returns a reference to the object's location in memory.

- runtime polymorphism
- derived/base class reference conversion
- derived or subclass
- base or superclass
- properties can be primitive or reference data types
- properies can be custom objects
- overloading vs overriding
